      <p>
        Wayback is distributed with a .jar file that
        simplifies creation of large-scale CDX files using hadoop. This code is
        experimental, and will primarily be useful only if your CDX files are
        very large - more than a few hundred GB (or more, depending on your
        hardware). If building or updating your CDX files is the
        largest problem with your installation, this may help. At IA, we've
        used this framework to build and deploy CDX files of more than 700GB,
        containing billions of records, using a 24 node cluster in about 8
        hours from start to finish. Just writing a 700GB file to disk at
        50MB/sec takes around 4 hours, so the final deployment step takes
        around half the time.

        Using hadoop to generate your CDX files requires the following 
        high-level process:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Integrating per-WARC CDX creation into your ingestion process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Building a split file, to inform hadoop on how to efficiently
            partition your data while sorting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Building a manifest listing the specific per-WARC CDX files to sort.
          </li>
          <li>
            Running the hadoop job, which produces a series of alphabetically
            contiguous, partitioned CDX in your HDFS.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Deploying the partitioned CDX files to your node running Wayback.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>   
      <subsection name="Process integration">
        <p>
          It is assumed you will integrate the Wayback indexing code, 
          <b>cdx-indexer</b> into your standard file ingestion workflow. That 
          is, whatever system is used to move data from your crawlers into your
          permanent repository should be modified to also build a CDX file for
          each W/ARC file, as it is ingested, and to store that CDX file in 
          your HDFS. As an optimization, you can compress the per-WARC CDX files
          before storing them in HDFS. If your per-W/ARC CDX files are named
          with a trailing, <b>.gz</b> suffix, the Wayback hadoop code will
          infer that these input files are compressed.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Building the split file">
        <p>
          CDX files are large sorted text files. Hadoop can be used to perform
          large distributed sort operations, but to achieve an efficient total
          ordering across your resulting data, you need to give hadoop some 
          explicit instructions, in the form of the split file, indicating
          how to distribute the data in your hadoop job.
        </p>
        <p>
          The split file is a text file, with each line indicating a partition
          point URL within the total possible URL space. The number of lines 
          determines the number of chunks that will be built within hadoop, and
          it should be based on the number of concurrent Reduce tasks you can 
          run concurrently on your cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
          If R is the number of reduce tasks you can run <i>at the same time</i>
          on your hadoop cluster, you should use (R-5) as the second argument
          to <b>cdx-sample</b>, which is distributed in the wayback .tar.gz 
          distribution. 5 leaves a few spare reduce workers in case of node 
          failure, and for speculative execution in case some of your nodes
          are running slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more accurately the partition points evenly divide your particular
          collections URLs, the more optimally your hadoop distributed 
          processing will execute. It is assumed that if you are using this
          hadoop to generate your CDX, you will already have built a sizable
          CDX file for your collection. The <b>cdx-sample</b> tool will sample
          an existing sorted CDX file for your collection, and produce a list
          of URL partitions that can be used as the split file for your hadoop
          processing. You should use the most recent sizable CDX built using
          other methods with the <b>cdx-sample</b> tool. If you don't have a
          previously built sorted CDX file for your collection, create
          a sample sorted CDX file from 20 or 30 random per-WARC CDX files, as
          described elsewhere, and use that with the <b>cdx-sample</b> tool. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You might use something similar to the following command to build
          your split file, assuming an previously built, sorted CDX file for
          your collection called <b>existing.cdx</b>, and a total reducer
          capacity of <b>20</b>:
          <div>
          <pre>
cdx-sample existing.cdx 15 > split.txt
hadoop fs -put split.txt /user/brad/input-split.txt
          </pre>
          </div>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Building the manifest">
        <p>
          The second input file you will need is your list of per-WARC 
          (or per-ARC) CDX files to process.
        </p>
        <p>
          This file can be built using the <b>hadoop fs -ls</b> command, and
          should contain one line for each CDX file you want to sort into your
          final CDX file.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an example line suitable for a manifest file:
          <div>
          <pre>
hdfs:///cdx/COLL-A/COLLECTION-A-20080726045700-00019-ia400028.us.archive.org.warc.os.cdx.gz
          </pre>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          You might use something similar to the following command to build
          your manifest:
          <div>
          <pre>
hadoop fs -ls /cdx/collectionA | perl -ane 'print "hdfs://$F[-1]\n";' | grep cdx.gz > manifest.txt
hadoop fs -put manifest.txt /user/brad/input-manifest.txt
          </pre>
          </div>
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Running the job">
        <p>
          This is actually the simplest part! You just need to run:
          <div>
          <pre>
hadoop jar PATH_TO_WAYBACK_HADOOP_JAR cdxsort -m MAPS [--compress-output] SPLIT INPUT OUTPUT_DIR
          </pre>
          </div>
          The --compress-output option will cause the resulting CDX files in HDFS to be compressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example usage:
          <div>
          <pre> 
hadoop jar /home/brad/wayback-hadoop-jar-with-dependencies.jar cdxsort -m 470 --compress-output /user/brad/input-split.txt /user/brad/input-manifest.txt /user/brad/cdx-output
          </pre>
          </div>
          indicating 470 map tasks, and that the resulting files should be
          compressed. The number of map tasks to use should be roughly 1/3rd the
          number of lines in your INPUT file.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Deploying the production Wayback CDX:">
        <p>
          The previous hadoop command will create alphabetically contiguous, 
          sorted CDX files in your HDFS output directory(OUTPUT_DIR). To merge
          them into a single CDX file which can be efficiently searched using 
          Wayback, you need to dump them into a single, concatenated file.
          For now, you have to use some shell code:
          <div>
          <pre>
for i in `hadoop fs -ls OUTPUT_DIR | perl -ane 'print "$F[-1]\n";' | sort`; do
   hadoop fs -cat $i
done &gt; LOCAL_FILE
          </pre>
          </div>
          where OUTPUT_DIR is the same as the one specified in your hadoop job,
          and where LOCAL_FILE is where you want your target file to exist, on
          the local computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you did specified the --compress-output option with your 
          "hadoop jar ..." command, you will need to add 'zcat' as follows:
          <div>
          <pre>
for i in `hadoop fs -ls OUTPUT_DIR | perl -ane 'print "$F[-1]\n";' | sort`; do
   hadoop fs -cat $i | zcat
done &gt; LOCAL_FILE
          </pre>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, LOCAL_FILE is ready for use as a Wayback CDX.
        </p>
