            AnchorDate feature, tracking the date with which a user begins a

            AnchorWindow feature, which allows users to specify a maximum time

      <subsection name="Migration notes to 1.4.0 from 1.2.X">
        <p>
          Wayback 1.4.0 includes substantial code changes aimed at extending
          current capabilities, enabling planned future features, and
          stabilizing interfaces used in .jsp customizations. Since these
          changes would already require a significant update of existing
          customizations made to .jsp files, many non-vital cleanups to the
          source tree were included. The goal of implementing all of these
          features within this single release is to minimize future required
          updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a somewhat inclusive list of changes that will be required
          when upgrading to Wayback 1.4.0 from 1.2.X, divided into two main
          categories: changes required to Spring configuration, and changes
          required for .jsp customizations. Depending on the scope of the
          existing customizations in your installations, it may be simpler
          to modify your existing customizations to conform to new interfaces
          and packages, and in other cases, it may be simpler to begin with the
          new reference implementations and modify them to meet your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are changes not addressed here, or if you have questions
          regarding specific issues when upgrading, please direct these
          questions to the archive-access-discuss forum.

          impact customizations made to .jsp files used with 1.2.X. The bulk of
          the changes fit three categories:
          <ul>
            <li>
              class name and package changes requiring import tag updates.
              Please see .jsps in new distribution for updated packages.

            <li>
              <p>
                Java changes within .jsp files due to UIResults refactoring.
                Previously each type of response page had a unique class used
                to marshal context information to the .jsp files. These have all
                been refactored into a single class, 
                <b>org.archive.wayback.core.UIResults</b> which has methods to
                access the appropriate data in each case. Additionally, many
                convenience methods that were present on the various UI*Results
                classes have been removed, since convenience methods are now
                available on the core classes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>WaybackRequest</li>
                <li>CaptureSearchResult</li>
                <li>CaptureSearchResults</li>
                <li>UrlSearchResult</li>
                <li>UrlSearchResults</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              As an example, the Timestamp class is no longer used in the .jsp
              files, since all time information uses the Date class for
              localization. All of the above classes now have methods to
              directly return Dates.
              </p>
              <p>
                For specific examples, please see the reference .jsp files
                included with the new distribution.

            Now explicitly sets the <b>charset</b> component of replayed HTML
            page <b>Content-Type</b> HTTP headers in Archival URL mode. This
            overrides Tomcat's default behavior of explicitly setting this value
            to Tomcat's <b>default</b> encoding character set, if a document 
            does not set it explicitly. The original <b>Content-Type</b> HTTP
            header value is now returned as HTTP header
            <b>X-Wayback-Orig-Content-Type</b>.

            initial revision of "deduplicated" WARC record handling, which

          <li>
            now filters (literal) duplicate records from the ResourceIndex,

            <b>bin-search</b> command line tool now outputs a single stream of

            archival URL parsing of query end-date now assumes latest
